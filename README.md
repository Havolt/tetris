# tetris

You can find a live version of the app at the following link;

A list of controls can be found in the application under the controls button.

This is my own attempt at making the classic video game Tetris. It follows all the rules of the original Tetris and the pieces behave as expected. 

The game works utilizing an object with a data map which constantly knows what pieces are in what locations and what their status is.

The app has three different difficulty levels, sound effects, a pause option and a controls list.

A points system has been integrated into the game using an equation to reward points based on different amounts of lines destroyed at once.

I hope you enjoy trying out my app.
